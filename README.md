# Machine_Learning__Human_Centered_Design_Project
Many People are suffering every day, with external and internal factors constantly pressuring them to function through madness. 
This makes their mental and emotional health prone to trouble, and it is our job to listen to their concerns and engineer new methods to help them; 
hence help our community altogether.  After defining 3 different Prototypes to solve the problem under study and getting user feedback on each, 
we chose our final solution to be an application that allows users to write in their journals (to be sentimentally analyzed later),
set personal goals, get personalized recommendations, and track their overall mental health. Afterwards, we developed the Machine Learning aspect of the chosen prototype,
where we tried several models for sentiment analysis, compared results, and concluded. We then again asked for real-world user feedback and concluded with mentioning our future
plans.
Machine Learning: text-based emotion detection using support vector machines, TF-IDF vectorizer, Neural Networks, GloveVector as word embeddings, Long Short Term Memory.
